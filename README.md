### 1. I used python for scraping the data via requests library and csv library to convert the data to csv format. I first sorted out the users and collected it in a file and then fetched info for users.csv and repositories.csv using the file.
### 2. INTERESTING AND SURPRISING FACT- The MIT license leads in popularity, followed by Apache-2.0 and GPL-3.0, indicating a preference for permissive or widely-accepted licenses. Unlicensed or custom licenses are also common. Most licenses show low popularity, with 80% of stargazers and watchers concentrated in the top four licenses, emphasizing limited variety in popular choices.
### 3. RECOMMENDATION FOR DEVELOPERS - Developers aiming for higher visibility and engagement should consider using the MIT, Apache-2.0, or GPL-3.0 licenses, as these attract larger communities. Choosing a widely-recognized, permissive license like MIT could broaden user adoption, while a license like GPL-3.0 might appeal to those valuing copyleft principles, fostering deeper contributions.
